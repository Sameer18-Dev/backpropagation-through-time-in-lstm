# Backpropagation Through Time in LSTM

The code is divided into several parts, the specifics of each part are explained below:

### Section 1: Introduction to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture and remember long-term dependencies in sequential data. In this notebook, we will implement a basic LSTM model using TensorFlow and explore its components.

### Section 2: LSTM Cell Implementation
The LSTM cell consists of several components: input gate, forget gate, cell update, and output gate. These gates control the flow of information through the cell, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies. The equations for each gate involve trainable weights and biases.

### Section 3: Forward Pass through LSTM Network
The forward pass involves processing input sequences through the LSTM cells, updating hidden states and cell states at each time step. This process allows the network to learn and capture temporal patterns in the data.

### Section 4: Backward Pass and Weight Updates
The backward pass calculates the loss and updates the weights and biases using gradient descent. We use the Adam optimizer to efficiently perform these updates.

### Section 5: Training the LSTM Model
Training the LSTM model involves iteratively performing forward and backward passes. The model learns to predict target values by adjusting its internal parameters.

### Section 6: Example Usage
An example demonstrating the usage of the implemented LSTM model with randomly generated input sequences and targets.
